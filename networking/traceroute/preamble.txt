Traceroute like a really cool program that shows you the life of a packet from the users end to it's final destinations. It does this
by creating UDP with custom TTl's in the header. Basically, traceroute makes a packet addressed to wics.uwaterloo.ca, but gives it
a header that says "kill this packet once it has made one destination hop". The first router to receive this packet sees this header,
sends back an ack. This is how traceroute gets the info about where this packets first hop would be. It then doest the same thing, but with 
a TTL of 2, and then 3, etc etc. 

Based on this traceroute output, what city is the user (fboxwala) likely located?
