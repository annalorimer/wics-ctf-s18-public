Alice just received a lovely letter from the Mad Hatter, but the Queen of Hearts (meanie that she is) has gone and ruined the whole thing.
It seems she's replaced every occurence of the letter w and W in the Mad Hatter's letter with 'q' and 'Qu'!!

Alice can't possibly understand the letter now. Can you help Alice out? She'd love to respond to the Mad Hatter with a nice answer
for his question. (The flag is the answer to the mad hatters question in digits)
