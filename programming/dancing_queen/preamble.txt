You're playing your favourite Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) song, Goin' Under. Here is a
recording of you dancing to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbejryzlTsk

In DDR, you can make four different dance steps with your feet: left, down, up, and right.

You want to get even better at your favourite song, so you decide to practice one of these
four directions of steps so that you're really good at making that direction of step.

You find the plain-text file that encodes your favourite song, at all of its five difficulties.
It is in the open-source .sm file format, described here: https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm

Specifically, on every line of the format 'ldur\n', each character is either '0' for no step,
or any other character for the existence of a step. A non-0 character in the 'l' position
means there is a left step at a certain beat, and similarily for the 'd' (down), 'up' (up),
and 'r' (right) positions. Thus, the line '1010\n' encodes a simultaneous left and up step.

What is the most common direction of step in "Goin' Under.sm", across all difficulties of the
song? And how many of the most common direction of step are there?

This three-digit number is the flag.
