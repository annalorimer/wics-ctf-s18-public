There are thousands of lines in the included .sm file, so you don't want to count them yourself.

The only lines you care about are 5-character-long lines ending with a newline.

The first character is 0 if there is no left step, something else otherwise.
Second character corresponds to down
Third character corresponds to up
Fourth character corresponds to right

e.g.

0000 is no steps
1000 is a left step
2000 is a different kind of left step but still a step
0110 counts as both an up and down step

the following python script prints out the number of each direction of step:


#!/usr/bin/env python3

with open("Goin' Under.sm") as f:
    relevant_lines = [ line for line in f if len(line) == 5 ]
    first = 0
    second = 0
    third = 0
    fourth = 0
    for line in relevant_lines:
        if line[0] != '0': first += 1
        if line[1] != '0': second += 1
        if line[2] != '0': third += 1
        if line[3] != '0': fourth += 1
    print(first, second, third, fourth)
