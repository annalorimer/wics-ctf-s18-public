The ENIAC was the first all-electronic digital computer in the US. It was comprised of approximately 18,000 vacuum tubes and forty,
8-foot panels. The ENIAC was eventually turned into the first "stored program" in the world. Only six programmers ever programmed this
computer at the machine level. All six of these programmers were women. For this flag, combine the first letter of each of these women,
sorted in an order.
