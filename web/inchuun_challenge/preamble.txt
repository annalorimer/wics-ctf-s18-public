You and two of your frenemies have been put into a group exam together.
The exam is required in order for you to continue your degree.

The exam is at: [HOST IP ADDRESS]:[SERVER PORT NUMBER, default 8080]

There must be answers somewhere on the server. 

You notice that the flag is the value of tau from question one, the part 
after the decimal point, if there is one.

[HINT]
It seems that the pages of the exam that you can view remind you
suspiciously of a copy of the course textbook your friends pirated,
and it strikes you that the answer key page was
the next page after the end of the visible exam pages.
